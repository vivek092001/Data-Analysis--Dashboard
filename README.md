# Data-Analysis--Dashboard
I have created a Dashboard Project on Superstore Dataset using Power BI. This process includes several stages , including data preprocessing, data cleaning and data visualization.

Overview/Executive Summary
At the top or in the center of the dashboard, you might find an executive summary area showcasing high-level KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), such as:

Total Sales: The aggregate sales revenue over a selected time period (e.g., last year, last quarter).
Total Profit: Total profit made across all transactions.
Total Quantity Sold: A summary of how many units of products have been sold.
Profit Margin: The ratio of profit to sales, showing how profitable the store is.
Number of Orders: Total number of orders placed by customers.
These KPIs help give a quick snapshot of the storeâ€™s overall performance.
